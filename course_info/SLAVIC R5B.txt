What poetic and narrative devices might a literary text use to construct bodily images, and what do these images imply or uncover about the embodied experience of a particular individual or group? How do specific discourses (e.g. of institutional power) shape, or attempt to shape, the representation of certain types of (marginalized, criminalized) bodies in art and literature? \n\nIn this course we will examine a range of works and genres from the nineteenth, twentieth, and twenty-first centuries in order to better understand the complex and often fraught relationship between discourse, literature, and bodily experience. Our texts will represent or reference a variety of literary bodies: grotesque bodies, the \u201cbody politic,\u201d body horror, gendered or racialized bodies, the disciplined or regulated body, and the body as symbol or metaphor. We will read poems, short prose, and novels by (primarily Russian and Soviet) writers including Nikolai Gogol, Edgar Allen Poe, Aleksandr Blok, Franz Kafka, William Faulkner, Andrei Platonov, Yevgeny Zamyatin, Varlam Shalamov, and Octavia Butler. Our encounters with these works of literary fiction will be informed by the critical writings of Michel Foucault, Susan Sontag, Julia Kristeva, and Judith Butler, among others. \n\nOver the course of the semester we will focus on developing the skills of college-level critical reading and writing. Students will outline, draft, write, and rewrite a series of essays, honing their ability to read closely and craft persuasive written arguments. Students will also gain experience identifying and incorporating secondary sources to support their original arguments.  \n\nWhile the majority of readings will be provided either online or in a course reader, students will be asked to purchase the following texts: \n\nAndrei Platonov.
