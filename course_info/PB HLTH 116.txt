Guest lecturers speak about the week\u2019s topic, which can include a variety of topics such as public health, violence, chronic illnesses, environmental health, and health care economics.  Speakers share their first-hand experiences in their fields, discuss current issues, debate ethical dilemmas, and pose and answer questions. During the weekly discussion sections, students delve deeper into the issues, not only exploring and perhaps questioning their own thoughts and beliefs, but also learning from the experiences and perspectives of their fellow students.
