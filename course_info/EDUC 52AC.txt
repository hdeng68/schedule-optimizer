The topics include dialects, Standard English, and slang; the influence of identity on language use; and the dynamic and diverse ways in which people use language to communicate with one another and in their communities.  The course will begin by exploring how people communicate within the university, or academic discourse, and how this impacts academic achievement.  Thus, a secondary objective is to examine literate strategies and practices of being a student that lead to higher academic achievement.","academicCareer":{"code":"UGRD","description":"Undergraduate"},"academicGroup":{"code":"GSE","description":"Grad School of Education"},"academicOrganization":{"code":"EDUCATION","description":"Education"},"departmentNicknames":"ED!","primaryInstructionMethod":{"code":"LEC","description":"Instructor presentation of course materials"},"credit":{"type":"fixed","value":{"fixed":{"units":3}}},"gradingBasis":{"code":"letter","description":"letter"},"blindGrading":false,"status":{"code":"ACTIVE","description":"ACTIVE"},"fromDate":"2015-08-19","createdDate":"2015-06-22","updatedDate":"2015-07-21","printInCatalog":true,"printInstructors":true,"anyFeesExist":false,"finalExam":{"code":"Y","description":"Written final exam conducted during the scheduled final exam period"},"instructorDropConsentRequired":false,"allowMultipleEnrollments":false,"contactHours":3,"workloadHours":9,"tie":{"code":"LECT","description":"LECT"},"cip":{"code":"MISSINGcipCode","description":"MISSINGcipCode"},"hegis":{"code":"MISSINGhegisCode","description":"MISSINGhegisCode"},"repeatability":{"repeatable":false},"creditRestriction":{"restrictionText":"","restrictionCourses":{"creditRestrictionCourses":[{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"602540f7-665a-4aab-a9f2-59fe8dbb32f3"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"124549"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"1eed0862-f56c-44ae-b939-d47a80562b8d"}],"displayName":"EDUC 52AC"},"maxCreditPercentage":100}]}},"proposedInstructors":["Mirabelli"],"formatsOffered":{"description":"Three hours of lecture per week.
