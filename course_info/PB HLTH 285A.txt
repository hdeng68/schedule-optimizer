Injuries are the leading cause of death from the first year of life to age 45, and the leading cause of lost potential years of life. This course provides an historical and conceptual framework within which to consider injuries (both intentional and unintentional) as social, and public health problems. Through review of epidemiology and intervention studies, course work will consider the causes and consequences of traumatic injury within developmental, social and economic contexts. Particular emphasis is placed on alternative strategies for injury prevention and on the relative benefits of intervention at different levels.
