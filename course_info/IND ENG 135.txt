The course introduces modern open source, computer programming tools, libraries, and code samples that can be used to implement data applications. The mathematical concepts highlighted in this course include filtering, prediction, classification, decision-making, Markov chains, LTI systems, spectral analysis, and frameworks for learning from data. Each math concept is linked to implementation using Python using libraries for math array functions (NumPy), manipulation of tables (Pandas), long term storage (SQL, JSON, CSV files), natural language (NLTK), and ML frameworks.","academicCareer":{"code":"UGRD","description":"Undergraduate"},"academicGroup":{"code":"COE","description":"Clg of Engineering"},"academicOrganization":{"code":"INDENG","description":"Industrial Eng & Ops Research"},"departmentNicknames":"IE!IEOR!INDENG!INDUSTRIAL ENGINEERING!","primaryInstructionMethod":{"code":"LEC","description":"Instructor presentation of course materials"},"credit":{"type":"fixed","value":{"fixed":{"units":3}}},"gradingBasis":{"code":"letter","description":"letter"},"blindGrading":false,"status":{"code":"ACTIVE","description":"ACTIVE"},"fromDate":"2017-08-16","createdDate":"2016-11-01","updatedDate":"2017-05-05","printInCatalog":true,"printInstructors":true,"anyFeesExist":false,"finalExam":{"code":"A","description":"Alternative method of final assessment"},"instructorDropConsentRequired":false,"allowMultipleEnrollments":false,"contactHours":3,"workloadHours":9,"tie":{"code":"LECT","description":"LECT"},"cip":{"code":"MISSINGcipCode","description":"MISSINGcipCode"},"hegis":{"code":"MISSINGhegisCode","description":"MISSINGhegisCode"},"repeatability":{"repeatable":false},"creditRestriction":{"restrictionText":"","restrictionCourses":{"creditRestrictionCourses":[{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"8d20f88d-86ab-40dd-8f3e-8f2bf7eaffe8"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"154879"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"2173897c-91d0-4810-8896-b60f9f3dc871"}],"displayName":"IND ENG 135"},"maxCreditPercentage":100},{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"8d20f88d-86ab-40dd-8f3e-8f2bf7eaffe8"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"154879"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"2173897c-91d0-4810-8896-b60f9f3dc871"}],"displayName":"IND ENG 135"},"maxCreditPercentage":100}]}},"studentLearningOutcomes":["Students will be able to design and build data sample application systems that can interpret and use data for a wide range of real life applications across many disciplines and industries;","implement these concepts within applications with modern open source CS tools.","understand relevant mathematical concepts that are used in systems that process data;"],"proposedInstructors":["Sidhu"],"formatsOffered":{"description":"Three hours of lecture per week.
