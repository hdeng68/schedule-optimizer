The course is designed to think through the social, political, and aesthetic effects of \u201cscreenic\u201d performances that combine dance, talk, gesture, and song; examine the role dancing plays in narrative development; consider how choreography produces and disseminates embodied knowledges; and discuss how dancing serves to both support and contest racial, gender, sexual, and class stereotypes. Primarily, we will look at Hollywood films and mainstream television shows, with brief forays into the world of live concert dance performance; tarry with a variety of theoretical texts from the fields of dance studies, performance studies, and cultural studies; and consult critical writings from newspapers and magazines.
