In his medieval masterpiece, the Divine Comedy, Dante irreversibly transformed literary language and perhaps even the way in which our current consciousness perceives the universe. Our course will focus on the first canticle of the Divine Comedy, both the most famous and most infamous: Inferno. Our goal will be to bring Dante\u2019s Hell to life, reconstructing the terrifying landscape and interpreting the complex poetry of a text that continues to resonate with modern audiences as intensely as it did with its medieval public.\n\nPreparation & Expectations:\nStudents should feel comfortable reading and analyzing poetry independently and have a strong writing style and composition skills. A knowledge of Italian is not required but students who have experience in Italian are encouraged to engage with the original text. Attendance is mandatory and energetic participation is strongly encouraged.\n\nStudents should be prepared to read approximately 2\u20133 cantos and their accompanying notes each week, as well as studying 2\u20133 selections from further primary and critical sources. In addition to preparing all required readings in advance of lecture and participating enthusiastically in class, students will be asked to prepare a comment or question each week based on the readings to facilitate debate during lectures. There will be three quizzes during the course and a final project where creative responses are encouraged.\n\nGrading Breakdown:\nAttendance and participation 20%\nReading responses 20%\nQuizzes 30%\nFinal Assignment 30%\n\nRequired Texts:\nAlighieri, Dante.
