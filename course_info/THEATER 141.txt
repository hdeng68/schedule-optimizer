Our study of these dance disciplines will inform the movement vocabulary, technical training, class discussions, and choreography we experience in this course. Additionally, in this course students will be challenged to learn more about body alignment, use of the core, dynamic expressive range, spatial awareness, improvisation techniques, and be challenged to explore and expand the range of their own movement identity.
