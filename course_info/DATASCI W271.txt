Central topics include linear regression, causal inference, identification strategies, and a wide-range of time series models that are frequently used by industry professionals. Throughout the course, we emphasize choosing, applying, and implementing statistical techniques to capture key patterns and generate insight from data. Students who successfully complete this course will be able to distinguish between appropriate and inappropriate techniques given the problem under consideration, the data available, and the given timeframe.","academicCareer":{"code":"GRAD","description":"Graduate"},"academicGroup":{"code":"INFO","description":"School of Information"},"academicOrganization":{"code":"INFO","description":"Information"},"departmentNicknames":"data, mids","primaryInstructionMethod":{"code":"WBL","description":"Web-based or technologically-mediated activities replacing standard lectures (effective Fall 2006)"},"credit":{"type":"fixed","value":{"fixed":{"units":3}}},"gradingBasis":{"code":"letter","description":"letter"},"blindGrading":false,"status":{"code":"ACTIVE","description":"ACTIVE"},"fromDate":"2017-01-10","createdDate":"2016-12-13","updatedDate":"2017-01-13","printInCatalog":true,"printInstructors":true,"anyFeesExist":false,"finalExam":{"code":"N","description":"No final exam"},"instructorDropConsentRequired":false,"allowMultipleEnrollments":false,"contactHours":3,"workloadHours":9,"tie":{"code":"LECS","description":"LECS"},"cip":{"code":"MISSINGcipCode","description":"MISSINGcipCode"},"hegis":{"code":"MISSINGhegisCode","description":"MISSINGhegisCode"},"repeatability":{"repeatable":false},"proposedInstructors":["Staff"],"formatsOffered":{"description":"Three hours of web-based lecture per week.
