The labs are centered on a large design with the focus on rapid design space exploration. The lab exercises culminate with a project design, e.g. implementation of a 3-stage RISC-V processor with a register file and caches. The design is mapped to simulation and layout specification.","academicCareer":{"code":"GRAD","description":"Graduate"},"academicGroup":{"code":"COE","description":"Clg of Engineering"},"academicOrganization":{"code":"ELENG","description":"Electrical Eng & Computer Sci"},"departmentNicknames":"","primaryInstructionMethod":{"code":"LAB","description":"Instructional experiences requiring special laboratory equipment and facilities"},"credit":{"type":"fixed","value":{"fixed":{"units":2}}},"gradingBasis":{"code":"letter","description":"letter"},"blindGrading":false,"status":{"code":"ACTIVE","description":"ACTIVE"},"fromDate":"2015-08-19","createdDate":"2015-02-05","updatedDate":"2015-08-21","printInCatalog":true,"printInstructors":true,"anyFeesExist":false,"finalExam":{"code":"N","description":"No final exam"},"instructorDropConsentRequired":false,"allowMultipleEnrollments":false,"contactHours":3,"workloadHours":6,"tie":{"code":"LABS","description":"LABS"},"cip":{"code":"MISSINGcipCode","description":"MISSINGcipCode"},"hegis":{"code":"MISSINGhegisCode","description":"MISSINGhegisCode"},"repeatability":{"repeatable":false},"creditRestriction":{"restrictionText":"","restrictionCourses":{"creditRestrictionCourses":[{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"32558bf0-9d2b-430b-b962-0dceeec6e9de"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"124557"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"7fad738a-be41-4f94-9d72-7e5a0e04a843"}],"displayName":"EECS 251LA"},"maxCreditPercentage":100}]}},"courseObjectives":["Software testing of digital designs is covered leading to a set of exercises that cover the design flow.
