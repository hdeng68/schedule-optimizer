They will learn how to write research proposals and how to give an effective presentation.  Through the research proposals, students will learn about the scientific-research process:  formulating the problem, determining the appropriate experimental methods, interpreting the results, and arriving at a conclusion.  Through presentations, students will gain valuable experience in public speaking and learn the process by which they would have to propose a research problem, be it in academia or industry.
