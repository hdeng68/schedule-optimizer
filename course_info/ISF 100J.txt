We will be doing this by employing a variety of methods, primarily historical and ethnographic, oriented around a study of practices.  We will pay attention to technical details but ground these technical details in social organization (a term whose meaning should become clearer and clearer as the class progresses).  We will study the social organization of computing around different kinds of hardware, software, ideologies, and ideas.
