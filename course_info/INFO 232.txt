The goal of this class is to deploy a few important theories about the relationship between information and behavior, into practical settings \u2014 emphasizing the design of experiments that can now be incorporated into many 'applications' in day-to-day life. Truly 'smart systems' will have built into them precise, testable propositions about how human behavior can be modified by what the systems tell us and do for us. So let's design these experiments into our systems from the ground up! This class develops a theoretically informed, practical point of view on how to do that more effectively and with greater impact.\n\n","academicCareer":{"code":"GRAD","description":"Graduate"},"academicGroup":{"code":"INFO","description":"School of Information"},"academicOrganization":{"code":"INFO","description":"Information"},"departmentNicknames":"","primaryInstructionMethod":{"code":"LEC","description":"Instructor presentation of course materials"},"credit":{"type":"fixed","value":{"fixed":{"units":3}}},"gradingBasis":{"code":"letter","description":"letter"},"blindGrading":false,"status":{"code":"ACTIVE","description":"ACTIVE"},"fromDate":"2014-08-21","createdDate":"2014-01-10","updatedDate":"2014-03-13","printInCatalog":true,"printInstructors":true,"anyFeesExist":false,"finalExam":{"code":"N","description":"No final exam"},"instructorDropConsentRequired":false,"allowMultipleEnrollments":false,"contactHours":3,"workloadHours":9,"tie":{"code":"LECS","description":"LECS"},"cip":{"code":"MISSINGcipCode","description":"MISSINGcipCode"},"hegis":{"code":"MISSINGhegisCode","description":"MISSINGhegisCode"},"repeatability":{"repeatable":false},"creditRestriction":{"restrictionText":"Students will receive no credit for Information 232 after completing Information 290 sect 6 (Fall 13).","restrictionCourses":{"creditRestrictionCourses":[{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"8db99a72-d355-4862-a877-9ce6433af4bb"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"110740"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"4c2a819a-ccad-41f4-b2bd-831bead15f0c"}],"displayName":"INFO 232"},"maxCreditPercentage":100},{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"8db99a72-d355-4862-a877-9ce6433af4bb"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"110740"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"4c2a819a-ccad-41f4-b2bd-831bead15f0c"}],"displayName":"INFO 232"},"maxCreditPercentage":100}]}},"proposedInstructors":["Weber"],"formatsOffered":{"description":"Three hours of lecture per week.
