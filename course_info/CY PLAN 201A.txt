Students will learn how to define planning problems; identify the information needed to better understand and develop solutions to those problems; collect data and conduct analysis to provide that information; and understand the mechanics, promises and pitfalls of those methods. Practical skills include downloading and using secondary data, conducting statistical tests of difference, observation, making maps from secondary data, interviewing, and conducting financial analyses. Through lectures, case studies, group assignments, and individual assignments, students will achieve the following learning objectives:\n\n"],"studentLearningOutcomes":["\u2022\tIdentify planning problems and questions\n\u2022\tDesign and implement a research project in response to a planning problem or question\n\u2022\tBecome a critical consumer of statistics, methods, and evidence\/arguments in the press and in policy, planning and advocacy publications\n\u2022\tThink critically about research problems and research design, learn what kinds of problems planners address in day-to-day life, and recognize the role of theory in shaping both questions and research design\n\u2022\tPrepare clear, accurate and compelling text, graphics and maps for use in documents and presentations\n\u2022\tBuild public presentation skills, and have an opportunity to practice and receive feedback on presentations of various lengths\n\u2022\tLearn how to write for different audiences, and effectively include data\/evidence in writing\n\u2022\tBe introduced to the faculty in DCRP and their research methods and approaches"],"proposedInstructors":["Chatman, Reid"],"formatsOffered":{"description":"Three hours of lecture and one hour of laboratory per week.
