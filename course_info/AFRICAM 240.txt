Throughout the course we will examine what forms economic institutions and practices take across the black Diaspora.

Through historical and ethnographic accounts we will explore how people across the Diaspora cope with crises and inequality, both individually and collectively, and how historical narratives are brought to bear on those methods, and on notions of the future."}}],"meetings":[{"number":1,"meetsDays":"We","meetsMonday":false,"meetsTuesday":false,"meetsWednesday":true,"meetsThursday":false,"meetsFriday":false,"meetsSaturday":false,"meetsSunday":false,"startTime":"10:00:00","endTime":"12:59:00","location":{"code":"BARR650","description":"Barrows 650"},"building":{"code":"1761","description":"Barrows"},"assignedInstructors":[{"assignmentNumber":1,"instructor":{"identifiers":[{"type":"campus-uid","id":"1101687","disclose":true}],"names":[{"type":{"code":"PRF","description":"Preferred"},"familyName":"Lewis","givenName":"Jovan","formattedName":"Jovan Scott Lewis","disclose":true,"uiControl":{"code":"U","description":"Edit - No Delete"},"fromDate":"1902-02-01"},{"type":{"code":"PRI","description":"Primary"},"familyName":"Lewis","givenName":"Jovan","formattedName":"Jovan Scott Lewis","disclose":true,"uiControl":{"code":"D","description":"Display Only"},"fromDate":"2015-03-10"}]},"role":{"code":"PI","description":"1-TIC","formalDescription":"Teaching and In Charge"},"printInScheduleOfClasses":true,"gradeRosterAccess":{"code":"A","description":"Approve","formalDescription":"Approve"}}],"startDate":"2018-08-22","endDate":"2018-12-07","meetingTopic":[]}],"class":{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"100115"}],"subjectArea":{"code":"AFRICAM","description":"African American Studies"},"catalogNumber":{"number":"240","formatted":"240"},"displayName":"AFRICAM 240","title":"Special Topics in Cultural Studies of the Diaspora","transcriptTitle":"SPEC TOPICS"},"offeringNumber":1,"session":{"term":{"id":"2188","name":"2018 Fall"},"id":"1","name":"Regular Academic Session"},"number":"002","displayName":"2018 Fall AFRICAM 240 002","allowedUnits":{"minimum":4,"maximum":4,"forAcademicProgress":4,"forFinancialAid":4}},"attributes":{"VUOC":[{"attribute":{"code":"VUOC","description":"VCREDIT","formalDescription":"Variable Units of Credit"},"value":{"code":"R","description":"Inclusive","formalDescription":"Inclusive range from Unit 1 or Unit 2"}}],"TIE":[{"attribute":{"code":"TIE","description":"Instr Type","formalDescription":"Instructional Activity Types"},"value":{"code":"SEMT","description":"Seminar-Topical","formalDescription":"Transmitting the Knowledge Base"}}],"NOTE":{"special-title":{"attribute":{"code":"NOTE","formalDescription":"Special Title"},"value":{"code":"2","formalDescription":"Race and Economy in the Black Diaspora"}},"class-description":{"attribute":{"code":"NOTE","formalDescription":"Class Description"},"value":{"code":"4","formalDescription":"This course examines the economy as a domain of social analysis for understanding the black experience.
