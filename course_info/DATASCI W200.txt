Students gain frequent practice writing code, building to advanced skills focused on data science applications. We introduce a range of Python objects and control structures, then build on these with classes on object-oriented programming. A major programming project reinforces these concepts, giving students insight into how a large piece of software is built and experience managing a full-cycle development project. The last section covers two popular Python packages for data analysis, Numpy and Pandas, and includes an exploratory data analysis.","academicCareer":{"code":"GRAD","description":"Graduate"},"academicGroup":{"code":"INFO","description":"School of Information"},"academicOrganization":{"code":"INFO","description":"Information"},"departmentNicknames":"data, mids","primaryInstructionMethod":{"code":"WBL","description":"Web-based or technologically-mediated activities replacing standard lectures (effective Fall 2006)"},"credit":{"type":"fixed","value":{"fixed":{"units":3}}},"gradingBasis":{"code":"letter","description":"letter"},"blindGrading":false,"status":{"code":"ACTIVE","description":"ACTIVE"},"fromDate":"2017-05-22","createdDate":"2017-02-17","updatedDate":"2017-02-21","printInCatalog":true,"printInstructors":true,"anyFeesExist":false,"finalExam":{"code":"N","description":"No final exam"},"instructorDropConsentRequired":false,"allowMultipleEnrollments":false,"contactHours":3,"workloadHours":9,"tie":{"code":"LECT","description":"LECT"},"cip":{"code":"MISSINGcipCode","description":"MISSINGcipCode"},"hegis":{"code":"MISSINGhegisCode","description":"MISSINGhegisCode"},"repeatability":{"repeatable":false},"creditRestriction":{"restrictionText":"","restrictionCourses":{"creditRestrictionCourses":[{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"366655a9-ede3-414a-8dd0-bcb23a151a43"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"154233"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"07ebb91a-3821-44fe-a798-36508d44d742"}],"displayName":"DATASCI W200"},"maxCreditPercentage":100},{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"3679d846-0e28-45b8-8768-bf4bc07a2b84"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"154233"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"07ebb91a-3821-44fe-a798-36508d44d742"}],"displayName":"DATASCI W200"},"maxCreditPercentage":100}]}},"studentLearningOutcomes":["Be able to navigate a file system, manipulate files, and execute programs using a command line interface.","Be prepared for further programming challenges in more advanced data science courses.","Be able to generate an exploratory analysis of a data set using Python.","Know how to read, manipulate, describe, and visualize data using the Numpy and Pandas packages.","Understand the principles of functional programming.","Know how to use Python to extract data from different type of files and other sources.","Be able to test and effectively debug programs.","Understand the principles of object-oriented design and the process by which large pieces of software are developed.","Be able to design, reason about, and implement algorithms for solving computational problems.","Be fluent in Python syntax and familiar with foundational Python object types.","Understand how to manage different versions of a project using Git and how to collaborate with others using Github."],"proposedInstructors":["Laskowski"],"formatsOffered":{"description":"Three hours of web-based lecture per week.
