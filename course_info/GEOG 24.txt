President Trump is one expression of this conjuncture but the goal is not to spend time on his presidency as such \u2013 or his latest tweets, or indeed the ever changing cast of characters in the White House. This seminar is not simply (another?) excuse to provide an inventory of the latest tweets from  President Trump (or sings his praises, I suppose).  Rather, I want to focus on ideas, both conservative and liberal ideas, and how and under what economic, social and cultural circumstances a set of beliefs about government, liberty, freedom etc., came to hold (and apparently continue to hold) enormous appeal for many American voters: that is to say, people who voted for President Trump and his vision of  America, of American greatness, of  the undoing of the \u201cadministrative state\u201d, of political life (\u2018Washington elites\u2019, the \u2018swamp\u2019), of a robust nationalism and anti \"global elites\", of America\u2019s role in the world,  and so on. These ideas are typically referred to as \u201cpopulist\u201d -- or \u201cauthoritarian populist\u201d -- and are seen to have broad appeal across large swaths of Western Europe and beyond (from Brexit to Hindutva).  But what exactly is populism? What is its ideological form? What style of politics does it generate? What is its history (in the US) and what makes contemporary populism similar to or different from the past? What is populism\u2019s relation to conservatism (or Republican thought)?  Is the rise of the so-called alt-right the same as a resurgent populism?  Are these ideas \u2013 as some have claimed \u2013 neo-fascist (\u2018Fascism American style\u2019)? And how do we understand the social basis of the appeal of these ideas (who voted for Trump and why?)?  Again, the conventional view is that authoritarian populism is about white working class rage (of a particular generation or region). In this sense I want to explore a related (one might say dialectical) question: To what extent does contemporary populism in its Trump variant define itself against \u2013 and draw strength from \u2013 its \u2018other\u2019: let\u2019s just call this identity politics, or more broadly certain strands of American liberal thought and practice? Here questions of race (and the legacies of slavery), gender, sexuality, religion figure centrally. In this sense the seminar addresses two  broad, complex and often contradictory lines of political thinking \u2013 two complex sets of political ideologies if you like \u2013 that are inseparable and party define one another: one broadly Republican and conservative, the other liberal and social democratic. This seminar is an opportunity to explore the current moment \u2013 and its conditions of possibility (how it came to be in this place at this time) \u2013 as a particular form and expression of American politics. We could of course spend all year (all of your undergraduate life on campus!) trying to work through this conundrum.  We\u2019ll just get our feet wet \u2013 damp, perhaps \u2013 and given our limited time together explore some of these ideas in an open and critical way and assess where we are a year or so into the Trump administration and how this moment speaks to wider issues of the American body politic."}}],"meetings":[{"number":1,"meetsDays":"We","meetsMonday":false,"meetsTuesday":false,"meetsWednesday":true,"meetsThursday":false,"meetsFriday":false,"meetsSaturday":false,"meetsSunday":false,"startTime":"12:00:00","endTime":"13:00:00","location":{"code":"MCCN575","description":"McCone 575"},"building":{"code":"1762","description":"McCone"},"assignedInstructors":[{"assignmentNumber":1,"instructor":{"identifiers":[{"type":"campus-uid","id":"4931","disclose":true}],"names":[{"type":{"code":"PRF","description":"Preferred"},"familyName":"Watts","givenName":"Michael","formattedName":"Michael J Watts","disclose":true,"uiControl":{"code":"U","description":"Edit - No Delete"},"fromDate":"1902-02-01"},{"type":{"code":"PRI","description":"Primary"},"familyName":"Watts","givenName":"Michael","formattedName":"Michael J Watts","disclose":true,"uiControl":{"code":"D","description":"Display Only"},"fromDate":"1979-07-01"}]},"role":{"code":"PI","description":"1-TIC","formalDescription":"Teaching and In Charge"},"printInScheduleOfClasses":true,"gradeRosterAccess":{"code":"A","description":"Approve","formalDescription":"Approve"}}],"startDate":"2018-08-22","endDate":"2018-12-07","meetingTopic":[]}],"class":{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"108665"}],"subjectArea":{"code":"GEOG","description":"Geography"},"catalogNumber":{"number":"24","formatted":"24"},"displayName":"GEOG 24","title":"Freshman Seminar","transcriptTitle":"FRESHMAN SEMINAR"},"offeringNumber":1,"session":{"term":{"id":"2188","name":"2018 Fall"},"id":"1","name":"Regular Academic Session"},"number":"001","displayName":"2018 Fall GEOG 24 001","allowedUnits":{"minimum":1,"maximum":1,"forAcademicProgress":1,"forFinancialAid":1}},"attributes":{"VUOC":[{"attribute":{"code":"VUOC","description":"VCREDIT","formalDescription":"Variable Units of Credit"},"value":{"code":"F","description":"Fixed","formalDescription":"Fixed Unit 1 Value"}}],"TIE":[{"attribute":{"code":"TIE","description":"Instr Type","formalDescription":"Instructional Activity Types"},"value":{"code":"SEMT","description":"Seminar-Topical","formalDescription":"Transmitting the Knowledge Base"}}],"NOTE":{"special-title":{"attribute":{"code":"NOTE","formalDescription":"Special Title"},"value":{"code":"2","formalDescription":"The Political Present"}},"class-description":{"attribute":{"code":"NOTE","formalDescription":"Class Description"},"value":{"code":"4","formalDescription":"The purpose of this seminar is to explore the contours of what we might call the American \u2018political present\u2019.
