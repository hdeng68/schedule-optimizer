Most graduate students receive specific training in their subject area, research methodologies, and technical writing. But fewer PhD students receive direct input on their process. Although there is no one-size-fits-all \"effectiveness training\", the goal of this seminar is to explore tools for surviving - and thriving - in the PhD process. We will address several core questions. What are strategies for efficiency and effectiveness at work? What are strategies for balancing personal and professional growth? How can we better define our goals and orient towards fulfilling them? We will address these questions with a combination of activities and discussions and requires a willingness to evaluate your own strengths and limitations and to engage in group work with your peers.
