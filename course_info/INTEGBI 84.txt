When his competitive days were over Brooks earned a Ph.D. in Exercise Physiology at the University of Michigan and subsequently took a post-doctoral fellowship in Muscle\nBiology and the University of Wisconsin. Brooks then joined the University of California Berkeley (Cal) Faculty in July of 1971. As a young exercise physiologist Brooks helped lead the transition from traditional organ systems physiology to include major aspects of cell and molecular biology, specifically in the areas of metabolism, mitochondrial bioenergetics and biogenesis. At Cal Brooks retained an interest in understanding human performance during exercise and at high altitude, but he turned his attention his attention to studying basic metabolic processes to better understanding of human capabilities in health and disease. In recent years, Brooks and colleagues developed two working hypotheses: The Lactate Shuttle, and the \"Crossover Concept.\" Research on the Lactate Shuttle as been to elucidate the pathways and controls of lactate (lactic acid) formation and removal before,\nduring and after exercise. The work involved studies on humans and animals, the use of isotope tracers, muscle biopsies, arterial-venous difference, cardiovascular, pulmonary and endocrine measurements. Along the way Brooks and colleagues discovered that the body makes lactate all the time, and that endurance training develops the capacities to produce, remove and utilize lactate as a fuel energy source. Hence, studies testing Lactate Shuttle theory have revealed three functions of lactate; lactate is a fuel energy source, the main gluconeogenic precursor, and a signaling molecule with autocrine, paracrine and endocrine functions. In fact, they demonstrated that lactate is favored as a fuel by working red muscle, heart, liver and brain. Most recent research shown that lactate is a favored brain fuel in healthy and injured persons and clinical research studies are under way to improve outcomes in traumatic brain injury patients using lactate supplementation. Recently also Brooks and colleagues noted similarities between metabolic responses in exercise and cancer; a feature of cancer cells being aerobic glycolysis and lactate production (i.e., the Warburg Effect). Currently, independent investigators and pharmaceutical firms are attempting to control cancer cell proliferation by developing Lactate Shuttle blockers. Along the way they also discovered that the muscle respiratory apparatus is comprised of a large network, a \u201cmitochondrial reticulum\u201d that doubles in mass in\nresponse to regular exercise because training increases the expression of hundred of genes. Their studies on mitochondrial biogenesis revealed important roles for free radicals in cellular adaptations, and several of their papers are \u201cCitation Classics\u201d having been cited thousands of times in the scientific literature. \n\nAt Cal Professor Brooks has served on many departmental and University committees. As well, he has served on several NIH grant review committees (Study Sections), and for the National Academies of Science he helped compile the science behind dietary and physical activity guidelines. Brooks has received Honor Awards form the American Physiological Society and the American College of Sports Medicine. Combined with expertise in applying isotope tracer technology to study metabolism in men and women in vivo, important lessons were learned about how regular exercise and sound nutrition promote body health and extend the health span."}},{"attribute":{"code":"NOTE","formalDescription":"Class Description"},"value":{"code":"4","formalDescription":"Professor George A.
