Bringing together the arts and the sciences, the course will examine the role of visual and urban cultures in shaping economic, political, engineering, agricultural, and scientific experiments centered on the earth\u2019s ecosystem in the past and in the present. We will analyze key ecological concepts such as energy flow, waste, technology, conservation, and environmental politics as it relates to global visual and urban cultures. Case studies will range from North American indigenous arts to Asian gardens, from colonial medicine to eco-activism in the Global South, from Renaissance experiments in botany to biotech, from urban planning in the ancient world to contemporary green infrastructure. Fieldtrips will include sustainability projects on campus and in the Bay Area.
