Because the class is an advanced course, we generally assume familiarity with the concepts and spend more time on the implementation. Every lecture is followed by a hands-on assignment, where students get to experience some of the technologies covered in the lecture. By the time students complete the course, they should be able to name the big data problem they are facing, select proper tooling, and know enough to start applying it.","academicCareer":{"code":"GRAD","description":"Graduate"},"academicGroup":{"code":"INFO","description":"School of Information"},"academicOrganization":{"code":"INFO","description":"Information"},"departmentNicknames":"data, mids","primaryInstructionMethod":{"code":"WBL","description":"Web-based or technologically-mediated activities replacing standard lectures (effective Fall 2006)"},"credit":{"type":"fixed","value":{"fixed":{"units":3}}},"gradingBasis":{"code":"letter","description":"letter"},"blindGrading":false,"status":{"code":"ACTIVE","description":"ACTIVE"},"fromDate":"2017-05-22","createdDate":"2016-11-18","updatedDate":"2016-11-21","printInCatalog":true,"printInstructors":true,"anyFeesExist":false,"finalExam":{"code":"N","description":"No final exam"},"instructorDropConsentRequired":false,"allowMultipleEnrollments":false,"contactHours":3,"workloadHours":9,"tie":{"code":"LECT","description":"LECT"},"cip":{"code":"MISSINGcipCode","description":"MISSINGcipCode"},"hegis":{"code":"MISSINGhegisCode","description":"MISSINGhegisCode"},"repeatability":{"repeatable":false},"proposedInstructors":["Staff"],"formatsOffered":{"description":"Three hours of web-based lecture per week.
