Both systems of logic will be motivated by the attempt to explicate the informal notion of a valid argument. Intuitively, an argument is valid when the conclusion \u2018follows\u2019 from the premises. In order to give an account of this notion we will introduce a deductive system (a natural deduction system), which explicates the intuitive notion of \u2018follow\u2019 in terms of derivational rules in a calculus. This will be done in stages, first for propositional reasoning (only connectives such as \u2018and\u2019, \u2018or\u2019, \u2018if\u2026 then\u2026\u2019) and later for the full first-order calculus (including expressions such as \u2018for all\u2026\u2019 and \u2018there exists\u2026\u2019). In addition, we will also develop techniques for showing when a claim does not follow from the premises of an argument. This is done by developing the semantics for the propositional and the predicate calculus. We will introduce truth-tables for the propositional connectives and \u2018interpretations\u2019 for sentences of first-order logic. At the end of the course, if time allows, we will also cover some metatheoretical issues, such as soundness and completeness of the propositional calculus. Textbook: J. Barwise, J.
