It will encourage you to think both broadly and pragmatically about the function of pedagogy in art history in particular: what we learn, how we teach, and who we are as teachers in this field. You will develop strategies to lead sections and to grade papers and exams effectively. We will discuss strategies to help students think and write in visual terms, to guide them to more critical modes of reading and writing, to mentor them in independent research, and to ensure that they work to the best of their potential. We will spend time learning about resources on campus to support student learning, undergraduate research, undergraduate-graduate mentoring, teaching assessment, and to foster equity, diversity, and inclusion in the classroom.\n\nThis class is also designed to help you envision and plan what your own teaching will be like when you are designing and instructing courses. Throughout the semester, you will develop a syllabus, paper prompts, and a grading rubric for an R1B course on a topic of your choice for the campus Reading and Composition (R&C) program. Your final project will be a teaching portfolio, which will incorporate this work and a statement explaining your philosophy of teaching. We will also talk about the formation and development of our academic identities as scholars and teachers, as you begin to look ahead to future careers.\n\nThis seminar satisfies a University-wide requirement that all first-time Graduate Student Instructors take a pedagogy course. It can be taken concurrently with a first teaching assignment or in the semester before beginning teaching. This course is designed for doctoral students in History of Art.
