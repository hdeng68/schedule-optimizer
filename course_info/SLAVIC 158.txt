In the recent centuries, it has become a real thing, a thing of debate.  We will focus on the latter, but the lectures will range more broadly.  We will discuss tensions around the creation, loss, re-creation, fragmentation of the idea and the thing in the modern period, since the beginning of the modernperiod.  Class readings will be novels from the period.  The list looks long, but it isn\u2019t.  Only six novels.  Three are long, and masterpieces, but two of them are unfinished and will be treated as such.  The rest are short\u2014also masterpieces.  Large portions of our discussions will focus on the use of the \u201cEuropean Question\u201d as material and structure for these six classic novels.\n\nHalf of the grade is reflected in showing up (attendance will be noted\u2014of course you will be excused for good reasons, just tell me) and participating.  Participation means, in large part, identifying and preparing daily passages you wish to comment on, bring to the attention of the class and the instructor, ask for help from all of us in interpretation, etc.  I will call on each of you during each session.  Nothing stressful; most people enjoy it.  The entire class certainly does.\n\nThe midterm, a 5-page paper, will be a preparation for the final paper (15- to 20-page).
