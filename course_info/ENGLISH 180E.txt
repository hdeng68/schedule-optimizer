This course will follow these two threads from antiquity to the Renaissance. We will read the story of Troy and the Trojans as it was told and retold by the Greeks (Homer\u2019s Iliad and Odyssey), the Romans (Virgil\u2019s Aeneid), in the Middle Ages (Chaucer\u2019s Troilus and Criseyde), and in Elizabethan England (Shakespeare\u2019s Troilus and Cressida). At the same time, we will see what happens to the genre of epic over time, as historical circumstances change and cultural priorities shift. We will define what we mean by \u201cepic,\u201d as well as what Homer, Virgil, Chaucer, and Shakespeare meant when they invoked the genre. Each of these texts imagines a world of possibilities and limitations; we will compare those freedoms and unfreedoms, what is speakable and unspeakable in Homer\u2019s world versus Virgil\u2019s world versus Chaucer\u2019s world versus Shakespeare\u2019s world.
