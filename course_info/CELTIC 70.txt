The course will present an overview of the history of the Celtic speaking peoples from Indo European times to the present concentrating particularly on questions of assessing evidence.  How are we to interpret Roman or Greek views of the Celts?  How do we know about languages of which there are no written records?  We will discuss the extent to which Celtic culture can be seen as a unitary phenomenon at various periods.  The course will cover what we know and what we may be able to reconstruct of Celtic belief systems and social structure.  For the later historical period we will dis\u00accuss Celtic tribal migration, cultural absorption, and linguistic fragmentation.  \n\nCourse requirements:\n1.)  3 short quizzes in class: Wednesdays 19 Sept., 17 Oct., 14 Nov. \n2.)  1 group report in class: Oct. 22, 24 and 26\n3.)  1 final 3 hour examination.  \n\nReading:\nCaesar, Julius, Seven Commentaries on The Gallic War\nWith an Eighth Commentary by Aulus Hirtius,\nTranslated with Introduction and Notes by Carolyn Hammond\nOxford University Press, ISBN: 0192835823, paper, 320 pages\n\nJames, Simon, the World of the Celts\nThames & Hudson; 3rd edition (October 1, 2005) \n ISBN-10: 0500279985 \n ISBN-13: 978-0500279984\n\nKoch, John, The Celtic Heroic Age,\nCeltic Studies Publications,1997, 4th edition, August 2003\nISBN 1891271091.
