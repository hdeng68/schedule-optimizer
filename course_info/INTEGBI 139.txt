It will adopt a broad-based approach to explore the concepts of stress, health, and disease, with a particular focus on current primary literature. The course will cover multiple dimensions in the study of stress, which employ genetic, epigenetic, molecular, cellular, physiological, and cognitive approaches, especially in the context of endocrine and neuroscience research.  We will analyze the individual response to stress, how genetic and environmental factors play a role in it, how it translates to physiological and mental health and well-being vs. pathological conditions, and put that in a public health perspective. \n","academicCareer":{"code":"UGRD","description":"Undergraduate"},"academicGroup":{"code":"CLS","description":"Clg of Letters & Science"},"academicOrganization":{"code":"INTEGBI","description":"Integrative Biology"},"departmentNicknames":"IB!IBIO!INT BIO!INTBIO!INTGRBIO!","primaryInstructionMethod":{"code":"LEC","description":"Instructor presentation of course materials"},"credit":{"type":"fixed","value":{"fixed":{"units":4}}},"gradingBasis":{"code":"letter","description":"letter"},"blindGrading":false,"status":{"code":"ACTIVE","description":"ACTIVE"},"fromDate":"2014-08-21","createdDate":"2013-12-04","updatedDate":"2014-01-17","printInCatalog":true,"printInstructors":true,"anyFeesExist":false,"finalExam":{"code":"Y","description":"Written final exam conducted during the scheduled final exam period"},"instructorDropConsentRequired":false,"allowMultipleEnrollments":false,"contactHours":4,"workloadHours":12,"tie":{"code":"LECS","description":"LECS"},"cip":{"code":"MISSINGcipCode","description":"MISSINGcipCode"},"hegis":{"code":"MISSINGhegisCode","description":"MISSINGhegisCode"},"repeatability":{"repeatable":false},"creditRestriction":{"restrictionText":"","restrictionCourses":{"creditRestrictionCourses":[{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"19ebbb0e-dd79-4fea-9ce0-13cf4e3162be"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":""},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"8d1da057-4456-4690-99d1-05e777710f65"}],"displayName":"INTEGBI 139"},"maxCreditPercentage":100}]}},"courseObjectives":["This course will emphasize the interconnected and multidirectional relationships between biology, behavior and the social environment.
