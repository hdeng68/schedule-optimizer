In addition to examining \u201cscenes of reading\u201d like Inferno 5 and Dante\u2019s textual definitions of and engagement with his own readers, we will consider questions concerning the intersections between authorial intentionality and readerly understanding; the self-reading mode of auto-commentary; appropriations and transformations of Scholastic models of lectio; the gender and social standing of implied readers; and others still. Though our primary focus will be on Dante\u2019s texts, we will take into consideration the circulation of those works around the time of their composition, as well as the first generation of the Commedia\u2019s readers. \n\nCourse Requirements: Students are expected to attend and participate regularly.
