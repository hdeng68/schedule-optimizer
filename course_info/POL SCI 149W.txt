Whatever the benefits of democracy, it seems dictatorship is here to stay. This course explores the characteristics and dynamics of non-democratic regimes: how and why they come about, what sustains them, why some people resist them and others do not, and how and why they decline and fall. We will explore a variety of examples from Africa, Asia, Europe, and Latin America. Using films and novels in addition to political science literature, we will investigate how dictators maintain their power, how ordinary people react to repression, and the links between dictatorship and security and economic development.\n\nSubfield: Comparative Politics\n\n\n\nNote: Course description is from Summer 2014"}}],"meetings":[{"number":1,"meetsDays":"MoWe","meetsMonday":true,"meetsTuesday":false,"meetsWednesday":true,"meetsThursday":false,"meetsFriday":false,"meetsSaturday":false,"meetsSunday":false,"startTime":"17:00:00","endTime":"18:29:00","location":{"code":"BARR170","description":"Barrows 170"},"building":{"code":"1761","description":"Barrows"},"assignedInstructors":[{"assignmentNumber":1,"instructor":{"identifiers":[{"type":"campus-uid","id":"261144","disclose":true}],"names":[{"type":{"code":"PRF","description":"Preferred"},"familyName":"Wittenberg","givenName":"Jason","formattedName":"Jason  Wittenberg","disclose":false,"uiControl":{"code":"U","description":"Edit - No Delete"},"fromDate":"2005-07-01"},{"type":{"code":"PRI","description":"Primary"},"familyName":"Wittenberg","givenName":"Jason","formattedName":"Jason  Wittenberg","disclose":false,"uiControl":{"code":"D","description":"Display Only"},"fromDate":"2005-07-01"}]},"role":{"code":"PI","description":"1-TIC","formalDescription":"Teaching and In Charge"},"printInScheduleOfClasses":true,"gradeRosterAccess":{"code":"A","description":"Approve","formalDescription":"Approve"}}],"startDate":"2018-08-22","endDate":"2018-12-07","meetingTopic":[]}],"class":{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"119109"}],"subjectArea":{"code":"POLSCI","description":"Political Science"},"catalogNumber":{"number":"149","suffix":"W","formatted":"149W"},"displayName":"POLSCI 149W","title":"Topics In Area Stdy","transcriptTitle":"TOPICS IN AREA STDY"},"offeringNumber":1,"session":{"term":{"id":"2188","name":"2018 Fall"},"id":"1","name":"Regular Academic Session"},"number":"001","displayName":"2018 Fall POLSCI 149W 001","allowedUnits":{"minimum":4,"maximum":4,"forAcademicProgress":4,"forFinancialAid":4}},"attributes":{"VUOC":[{"attribute":{"code":"VUOC","description":"VCREDIT","formalDescription":"Variable Units of Credit"},"value":{"code":"F","description":"Fixed","formalDescription":"Fixed Unit 1 Value"}}],"TIE":[{"attribute":{"code":"TIE","description":"Instr Type","formalDescription":"Instructional Activity Types"},"value":{"code":"LECS","description":"Lecture\/Supplementary Activity","formalDescription":"Transmitting the Knowledge Base"}}],"GE":[{"attribute":{"code":"GE","description":"Breadth","formalDescription":"Breadth Requirements"},"value":{"code":"SBS","description":"Social & Behavioral Sciences","formalDescription":"Meets Social & Behavioral Sciences, L&S Breadth"}}],"NOTE":{"special-title":{"attribute":{"code":"NOTE","formalDescription":"Special Title"},"value":{"code":"2","formalDescription":"TOPICS IN AREA STUDIES: DICTATORSHIP AND ITS DISCONTENTS"}},"class-description":{"attribute":{"code":"NOTE","formalDescription":"Class Description"},"value":{"code":"4","formalDescription":"The overwhelming majority of governments throughout history have been dictatorial.
