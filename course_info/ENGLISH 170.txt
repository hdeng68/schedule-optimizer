Following that injunction, this course asks how history is made vivid through art (including literature, theatrical performance, dance, music, and visual media) and how that art can help reframe or reinterpret histories that are seemingly remote, messy, or unfinished. We will read works of historical and counterfactual fiction\u2014from Walter Scott's Waverley (1814) to Colson Whitehead's The Underground Railroad (2016)\u2014alongside secondary texts from the fields of literary criticism, history and art history, philosophy, media studies, and cultural studies. In addition, we will study musical and visual art that puts the past back into play, from Kara Walker's debut installation Gone (1994) to the Hamilton (2015) soundtrack. Through these works and the Cal Performances events we attend, we will explore diverse theories of aesthetic and cultural change, from those that view art as a distraction from the \"real\" work of politics to those that regard art as the ideal medium for reimagining or redressing the past, and so reshaping the present. \n\nIn addition to the class meetings, students are required to attend the following evening performances: \n\nHenrik Ibsen, Schaub\u00fchne (Enemy of the People): Oct. 12-13\n\nWynton Marsalis and the Jazz at Lincoln Center Orchestra, Greek Theater: Sept. 23\n\nJordi Savall, Routes of Slavery: Nov. 3\n\nCompagnie K\u00e3fig, Pixel: Nov. 16-17\n\nBig Dance Theater, 17c: Dec. 13-16\n\nThis course, including free student tickets to performances, is made possible by Cal Performances, with support from the Andrew W.
