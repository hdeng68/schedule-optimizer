Cinema lent itself to representing and questioning this encounter. As Italian food and gestures landed onscreen, they became part of a common, sometimes stereotypical, imagery. In this course, we will explore thoroughly the origins and images of the Italian-American encounter beyond its overused definitions. Throughout this chronological exploration, we will start by exploring the cinematic portrait of migration and cultural exchanges across the Atlantic Ocean, which remains a privileged site to understand cultural and geo-political dynamics still informing our historical time.

In turning to filmmakers who, originally Italian, found themselves \u201cbecoming\u201d Americans, as in the mafia serial Sopranos and Mario Puzo's Godfather filmic transposition by F. F.
