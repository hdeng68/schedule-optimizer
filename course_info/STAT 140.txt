Data 8), there is considerable demand for follow-on courses that build on the skills acquired in that class. Stat 140 is a probability course for Data 8 graduates who have also had a year of calculus and wish to go deeper into data science. ","The syllabus has been designed to maintain a mathematical level at least equal to that in Stat 134. So Stat 140 will start faster than Stat 134 (due to the Data 8 prerequisite), avoid approximations that are unnecessary when SciPy is at hand, and replace some of the routine calculus by symbolic math done in SymPy. This will create time for a unit on the convergence and reversibility of Markov Chains as well as added focus on conditioning and Bayes methods.","The emphasis on simulation and the bootstrap in Data 8 gives students a concrete sense of randomness and sampling variability. Stat 140 will capitalize on this, abstraction and computation complementing each other throughout. \n"],"studentLearningOutcomes":["Work with probability concepts algebraically, numerically, and graphically","Understand the difference between math and simulation, and appreciate the power of both","Use a variety of approaches to problem solving"],"proposedInstructors":[""],"formatsOffered":{"description":"Three hours of lecture and two hours of laboratory and one hour of discussion per week.
