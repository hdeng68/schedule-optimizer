The time frame covered is from the sixties--years of rupture and experimentalism in artistic and cultural production\u2014to the present. Students will study the concrete poetry of the Portuguese author Ana Hatherly, the visual (\u201cConcrete\u201d) poems of the Brazilian author Haroldo de Campos, and the drawings of the Swiss-Brazilian artist Maria Schendel. The course content will include the multi-layered music of the Angolan duet Ouro Negro and the political essays of Cape Verdean academic Am\u00edlcar Cabral. Themes such as colonization, decolonization, freedom, will be among the larger, decidedly compelling group of subjects on which the course will touch.
