Students fulfilling Physical Science breadth in the College of Letters & Science may be motivated by the pure pleasure of penetrating the mysteries of the universe, or by more practical considerations such as a desire to take an intelligent stance on such topics as greenhouse gases and space exploration. Whether students opt for the practical or the theoretical or a combination of both, students choosing a lower-division course in this series will learn to formulate problems clearly and think quantitatively, critically, and abstractly.
