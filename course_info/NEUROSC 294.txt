Preparation and critiques of presentations will focus on organization of conceptual issues, data presentation, and summarization. 2) Exposure to current topics in neuroscience: faculty speakers will present on current issues and topics relevant to scientific development in the neurosciences, such as technical methods, application of analytical and statistical techniques, and organization and preparation of competitive fellowship and other grant applications. 3) Seminar preparation: a crucial aspect of graduate education is the interaction of students with invited seminar speakers - who are often leaders in their fields. A selected number of class meetings will be devoted to the review of scientific articles published by upcoming seminar speakers and\/or other related articles in the field.
