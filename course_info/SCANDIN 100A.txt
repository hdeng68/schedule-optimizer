Contact instructor for more information:  kmoller@berkeley.edu\n\nContinuing students of Danish, Norwegian, and Swedish enrolling in Scandinavian 100A will meet together for one hour of lecture per week (W 11-12) to read and interpret literary and nonliterary texts about inter-Scandinavian communication, linguistics, and language history.  In addition to this one-hour combined lecture, students will meet two additional hours per week (in discussion sections with a language instructor) to be instructed in their particular target languages.\n\nStudents should enroll in the relevant target language section as follows:  Section 101 = Danish\nSection 102 = Norwegian\nSection 103 = Swedish.\nStudents should register in the 100A lecture in addition to the relevant section they will attend. The course is complete with the language and the lecture sections \u2013 you must enroll in both parts in order to fully enroll in the course. If you experience a scheduling problem it is essential that you consult the language coordinator.\n\nStudents will further develop their basic communicative competence in all four foreign language skills (speaking, listening, reading and writing) within a cultural context in their own target language (Danish, Norwegian, or Swedish).  Through the weekly lecture they will gain a deeper understanding of the other Scandinavian languages through tasks and readings. Students will NOT be asked to learn to speak the other two Scandinavian languages, but to learn about them.\n\nPlacement:  Scandinavian 100A is open to students who have taken Danish, Norwegian, or Swedish 1A-1B with a passing grade. A placement test is mandatory for other students who have had 90 hours of in-class instruction (reached the Novice High\/Intermediate Low proficiency level) in any of the three Scandinavian languages and with a passing grade. The placement test must be taken prior to or within the first week of instruction. Contact the language coordinator, Karen Moller, to schedule a placement test. \n\nNative, Near-Native, Heritage Speakers:  The specific language sections are only open to learners of the specific Scandinavian language of instruction in the section.  The course is not open to native, near-native, or heritage speakers of any Nordic language without prior consent from the language coordinator. The course cannot be repeated without prior consent from the language coordinator.\n\nWorkload for the combined lecture (e.g. 1\/3 of the total grade for Scandinavian 100A):\nTwo hours of work outside class a week.

The structure of supplemental language sections depends on the language instructor, but usually includes weekly written assignments, oral presentations, an oral and written midterm and final exam.\n\nSection Times:  Meeting times for discussion sections might on occasion be changed according to the schedules of the students enrolled, and can therefore vary from the times listed in the online Schedule of Classes.
