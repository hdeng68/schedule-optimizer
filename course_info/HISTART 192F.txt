Pre-Raphaelite beauty was associated with truth to nature; Aesthetic beauty with subjectivity; Arts and Crafts beauty with socialism. Despite their differences, these three movements had much in common. Motivated by a shared belief that beauty was indispensable in art and in life, they developed diverse ways of introducing art into public spaces and objects of daily use. All three movements drew inspiration from past traditions. And they all wrestled with questions about the politics and morality of beauty. Over the course of the semester we look at artworks in a range of media including paintings, prints, sculptures, decorative arts, and interiors. Alongside the most recent scholarly literature and the writings of Victorian artists and critics, we consider philosophies of aesthetics and scientific theories of art and beauty.
