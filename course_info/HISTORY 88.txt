Will the advent of fast computing and big data make history \u201ccount\u201d more or lead to unprecedented insights into the study of change over time? During our weekly discussions, we will apply what we learn in lectures and labs to the analysis of selected historical sources and get an understanding of constructing historical datasets. We will also consider scholarly debates over quantitative evidence and historical argument.","academicCareer":{"code":"UGRD","description":"Undergraduate"},"academicGroup":{"code":"CLS","description":"Clg of Letters & Science"},"academicOrganization":{"code":"HISTORY","description":"History"},"departmentNicknames":"","primaryInstructionMethod":{"code":"LAB","description":"Instructional experiences requiring special laboratory equipment and facilities"},"credit":{"type":"fixed","value":{"fixed":{"units":2}}},"gradingBasis":{"code":"letter","description":"letter"},"blindGrading":false,"status":{"code":"ACTIVE","description":"ACTIVE"},"fromDate":"2016-01-12","createdDate":"2015-08-12","updatedDate":"2015-09-24","printInCatalog":true,"printInstructors":true,"anyFeesExist":false,"finalExam":{"code":"A","description":"Alternative method of final assessment"},"instructorDropConsentRequired":false,"allowMultipleEnrollments":false,"contactHours":2,"workloadHours":6,"tie":{"code":"LECS","description":"LECS"},"cip":{"code":"MISSINGcipCode","description":"MISSINGcipCode"},"hegis":{"code":"MISSINGhegisCode","description":"MISSINGhegisCode"},"repeatability":{"repeatable":false},"creditRestriction":{"restrictionText":"","restrictionCourses":{"creditRestrictionCourses":[{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"1956db36-e00f-44e2-8881-032ae12a7621"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"125389"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"516797d7-7f94-400a-8229-e40dac8ded05"}],"displayName":"HISTORY 88"},"maxCreditPercentage":100}]}},"proposedInstructors":["Carson"],"formatsOffered":{"description":"One-half hour of lecture and one hour of laboratory and one-half hour of discussion per week. 2-hour integrated lab\/lecture\/discussion","formats":[{"termsAllowed":{"termNames":["Fall"]},"sessionType":"15","description":"1.0 hours of laboratory, 0.5 hours of discussion, and 0.5 hours of lecture per week","aggregateMinContactHours":2,"aggregateMaxContactHours":2,"minWorkloadHours":6,"maxWorkloadHours":6,"anyFeesExist":false,"components":[{"instructionMethod":{"code":"LEC","description":"Instructor presentation of course materials"},"primary":false,"minContactHours":0.5,"maxContactHours":0.5,"finalExam":[],"feesExist":false},{"instructionMethod":{"code":"WRK","description":"Outside Work Hours"},"primary":false,"minContactHours":4,"maxContactHours":4,"finalExam":[],"feesExist":false},{"instructionMethod":{"code":"DIS","description":"The exchange of opinions or questions on course material"},"primary":false,"minContactHours":0.5,"maxContactHours":0.5,"finalExam":[],"feesExist":false},{"instructionMethod":{"code":"LAB","description":"Instructional experiences requiring special laboratory equipment and facilities"},"primary":true,"minContactHours":1,"maxContactHours":1,"finalExam":[],"feesExist":false}]},{"termsAllowed":{"termNames":["Spring"]},"sessionType":"15","description":"1.0 hours of laboratory, 0.5 hours of discussion, and 0.5 hours of lecture per week","aggregateMinContactHours":2,"aggregateMaxContactHours":2,"minWorkloadHours":6,"maxWorkloadHours":6,"anyFeesExist":false,"components":[{"instructionMethod":{"code":"LEC","description":"Instructor presentation of course materials"},"primary":false,"minContactHours":0.5,"maxContactHours":0.5,"finalExam":[],"feesExist":false},{"instructionMethod":{"code":"WRK","description":"Outside Work Hours"},"primary":false,"minContactHours":4,"maxContactHours":4,"finalExam":[],"feesExist":false},{"instructionMethod":{"code":"DIS","description":"The exchange of opinions or questions on course material"},"primary":false,"minContactHours":0.5,"maxContactHours":0.5,"finalExam":[],"feesExist":false},{"instructionMethod":{"code":"LAB","description":"Instructional experiences requiring special laboratory equipment and facilities"},"primary":true,"minContactHours":1,"maxContactHours":1,"finalExam":[],"feesExist":false}]}],"typicallyOffered":{"terms":{"termNames":["Spring","Fall"]},"comments":""},"summerOnly":false}},"subjectName":"HISTORY"}
