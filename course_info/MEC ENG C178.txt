Students will learn the design of external devices used to aid or protect the body. Topics will include forces acting on internal materials (e.g., muscles and total replacement devices), forces acting on external materials (e.g., prothetics and crash pads), design\/analysis of devices aimed to improve or fix the human body, muscle adaptation, and soft tissue injury. Weekly laboratory projects will incorporate EMG sensing, force plate analysis, and interpretation of data collection (e.g., MATLAB analysis) to integrate course material to better understand contemporary design\/analysis\/problems.","academicCareer":{"code":"UGRD","description":"Undergraduate"},"academicGroup":{"code":"COE","description":"Clg of Engineering"},"academicOrganization":{"code":"MECENG","description":"Mechanical Engineering"},"departmentNicknames":"ME!MECENG!MECH!MECH ENG!MECHANICAL ENGINEERING!MECHENG!","primaryInstructionMethod":{"code":"LEC","description":"Instructor presentation of course materials"},"credit":{"type":"fixed","value":{"fixed":{"units":3}}},"gradingBasis":{"code":"letter","description":"letter"},"blindGrading":false,"status":{"code":"ACTIVE","description":"ACTIVE"},"fromDate":"2016-08-17","createdDate":"2016-03-04","updatedDate":"2016-08-15","printInCatalog":true,"printInstructors":true,"anyFeesExist":false,"finalExam":{"code":"A","description":"Alternative method of final assessment"},"instructorDropConsentRequired":false,"allowMultipleEnrollments":false,"contactHours":5,"workloadHours":11,"tie":{"code":"LECS","description":"LECS"},"cip":{"code":"MISSINGcipCode","description":"MISSINGcipCode"},"hegis":{"code":"MISSINGhegisCode","description":"MISSINGhegisCode"},"repeatability":{"repeatable":false},"creditRestriction":{"restrictionText":"There will be no credit given for MEC ENG C178 \/ BIO ENG C137 after taking MEC ENG 178.\n\n","restrictionCourses":{"creditRestrictionCourses":[{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"988b5164-ff64-4696-8e9f-a3e05c41771c"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"125415"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"e7ff9bde-b8e4-4e9f-be2a-3729b5a5e52c"}],"displayName":"MEC ENG 178"},"maxCreditPercentage":100},{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"988b5164-ff64-4696-8e9f-a3e05c41771c"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"125415"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"e7ff9bde-b8e4-4e9f-be2a-3729b5a5e52c"}],"displayName":"MEC ENG 178"},"maxCreditPercentage":100},{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"33590e3e-7869-41ef-ade8-743b7a2acad1"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"125415"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"e7ff9bde-b8e4-4e9f-be2a-3729b5a5e52c"}],"displayName":"MEC ENG C178"},"maxCreditPercentage":100},{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"33590e3e-7869-41ef-ade8-743b7a2acad1"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"125415"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"e7ff9bde-b8e4-4e9f-be2a-3729b5a5e52c"}],"displayName":"MEC ENG C178"},"maxCreditPercentage":100}]}},"courseObjectives":["The purpose of this course is twofold: \n\u2022\tto learn the fundamental concepts of designing devices to interact with the human body;\n\u2022\tto enhance skills in mechanical engineering and bioengineering by analyzing the behavior of various complex biomedical problems;\n\u2022\tTo explore the transition of a device or discovery as it goes from \u201cbenchtop to bedside\u201d.
