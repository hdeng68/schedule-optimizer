This course will stress the link between financial economics and equilibrium theory. Less attention will be devoted to purely financial topics such as the valuation of derivatives. This course is intended as the segue between a first course in financial economics (at the undergraduate level) and graduate-level courses in financial economics and finance.\n\nThe idea is to introduce students to the full range of topics typically covered by a financial economics and\/or discrete time asset pricing course at the doctoral level.
