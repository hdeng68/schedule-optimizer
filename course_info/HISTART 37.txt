Beginning around 1945 and paying special attention to new avant-garde and experimental practices, the lectures will trace the emergence of abstraction, hyperrealism, pop, conceptualism, documentary video and photography, performance, multi-media installations, new media and video art, feminist and queer practices, site-specific projects, and participatory art. Although the 20th century has often been described as the Asian Century, many parts of the region remained engulfed in political turmoil and civil unrest while others functioned under military rule. The emergence of a range of experimental art and architecture movements coincided with these political developments. Consequently, our account will not only place Asia\u2019s art and architecture within the larger context of anti-censorship protests and civil society activist movements but also situate recent artistic and architectural practices within critical theories of contemporary art history more broadly. Our focus will be on Mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Japan, Korea, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Philippines, Myanmar, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Thailand."}}],"roomCharacteristics":[{"code":"41","description":"History of Art Projection","quantity":1}],"meetings":[{"number":1,"meetsDays":"TuTh","meetsMonday":false,"meetsTuesday":true,"meetsWednesday":false,"meetsThursday":true,"meetsFriday":false,"meetsSaturday":false,"meetsSunday":false,"startTime":"15:30:00","endTime":"16:59:00","location":{"code":"MOFF106","description":"Moffitt Library 106"},"building":{"code":"1299","description":"Moffitt"},"assignedInstructors":[{"assignmentNumber":1,"instructor":{"identifiers":[{"type":"campus-uid","id":"1010803","disclose":true}],"names":[{"type":{"code":"PRF","description":"Preferred"},"familyName":"Gupta","givenName":"Atreyee","formattedName":"Atreyee  Gupta","disclose":true,"uiControl":{"code":"U","description":"Edit - No Delete"},"fromDate":"1902-02-01"},{"type":{"code":"PRI","description":"Primary"},"familyName":"Gupta","givenName":"Atreyee","formattedName":"Atreyee  Gupta","disclose":true,"uiControl":{"code":"D","description":"Display Only"},"fromDate":"2012-08-01"}]},"role":{"code":"PI","description":"1-TIC","formalDescription":"Teaching and In Charge"},"printInScheduleOfClasses":true,"gradeRosterAccess":{"code":"A","description":"Approve","formalDescription":"Approve"}}],"startDate":"2018-08-22","endDate":"2018-12-07","meetingTopic":[]}],"class":{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"156248"}],"subjectArea":{"code":"HISTART","description":"History of Art"},"catalogNumber":{"number":"37","formatted":"37"},"displayName":"HISTART 37","title":"Contemporary Art + Architecture from Asia, ca. 1945-present","transcriptTitle":"CONTEM ART & ARCH"},"offeringNumber":1,"session":{"term":{"id":"2188","name":"2018 Fall"},"id":"1","name":"Regular Academic Session"},"number":"001","displayName":"2018 Fall HISTART 37 001","allowedUnits":{"minimum":4,"maximum":4,"forAcademicProgress":4,"forFinancialAid":4}},"attributes":{"VUOC":[{"attribute":{"code":"VUOC","description":"VCREDIT","formalDescription":"Variable Units of Credit"},"value":{"code":"F","description":"Fixed","formalDescription":"Fixed Unit 1 Value"}}],"TIE":[{"attribute":{"code":"TIE","description":"Instr Type","formalDescription":"Instructional Activity Types"},"value":{"code":"LECS","description":"Lecture\/Supplementary Activity","formalDescription":"Transmitting the Knowledge Base"}}],"GE":[{"attribute":{"code":"GE","description":"Breadth","formalDescription":"Breadth Requirements"},"value":{"code":"IS","description":"International Studies","formalDescription":"Meets International Studies, L&S Breadth"}},{"attribute":{"code":"GE","description":"Breadth","formalDescription":"Breadth Requirements"},"value":{"code":"AL","description":"Arts & Literature","formalDescription":"Meets Arts & Literature, L&S Breadth"}}],"NOTE":{"special-title":{"attribute":{"code":"NOTE","formalDescription":"Special Title"},"value":{"code":"2","formalDescription":"Contemporary Art + Architecture from Asia, ca. 1945-present"}},"class-description":{"attribute":{"code":"NOTE","formalDescription":"Class Description"},"value":{"code":"4","formalDescription":"This course will offer an overview of contemporary art and architecture from South, Southeast, and East Asia.
