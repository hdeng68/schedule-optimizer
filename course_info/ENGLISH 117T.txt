If you ever felt intrigued by the thought of what it would feel like to put it on, this is a class for you. During the semester, we will not only close read, analyze and interpret one of Shakespeare\u2019s strangest plays, Cymbeline, King of Britain, we will also have an opportunity to perform our own version of it.\n\nTo be sure, this is a literature class, and our purpose isn\u2019t to stage the finest ever version of the play, but to use performance as one more tool that will help us understand Shakespeare\u2019s text. In addition to the play, we will read some of its textual sources, critical essays on Shakespeare and Renaissance drama, some performance theory, and we will also watch theatrical and film adaptations of various Shakespeare plays. No previous acting experience required.\n\nRequired book: William Shakespeare, Cymbeline, ed. Barbara Mowat and Paul Werstine. Additional readings will be posted on bCourses and\/or distributed in class.\n\nNOTE:  Students should plan to attend, in addition to the lectures, the twice-weekly rehearsals, which will take place MW 3-4:30 in 300 Wheeler. Some additional rehearsals may also be needed as the performance date approaches.\n\nNOTE ALSO:  Because this course concentrates on one play only, it will not satisfy the Shakespeare requirement for English majors.\n\nSee also https:\/\/english.berkeley.edu\/courses\/5851"}}],"meetings":[{"number":1,"meetsDays":"MoWeFr","meetsMonday":true,"meetsTuesday":false,"meetsWednesday":true,"meetsThursday":false,"meetsFriday":true,"meetsSaturday":false,"meetsSunday":false,"startTime":"14:00:00","endTime":"14:59:00","location":{"code":"HMMB310","description":"Hearst Mining 310"},"building":{"code":"1373","description":"Hearst Min"},"assignedInstructors":[{"assignmentNumber":1,"instructor":{"identifiers":[{"type":"campus-uid","id":"972796","disclose":true}],"names":[{"type":{"code":"PRF","description":"Preferred"},"familyName":"Marno","givenName":"David","formattedName":"David  Marno","disclose":true,"uiControl":{"code":"U","description":"Edit - No Delete"},"fromDate":"1902-02-01"},{"type":{"code":"PRI","description":"Primary"},"familyName":"Marno","givenName":"David","formattedName":"David  Marno","disclose":true,"uiControl":{"code":"D","description":"Display Only"},"fromDate":"2011-06-30"}]},"role":{"code":"PI","description":"1-TIC","formalDescription":"Teaching and In Charge"},"printInScheduleOfClasses":true,"gradeRosterAccess":{"code":"A","description":"Approve","formalDescription":"Approve"}}],"startDate":"2018-08-22","endDate":"2018-12-07","meetingTopic":[]}],"class":{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"106745"}],"subjectArea":{"code":"ENGLISH","description":"English"},"catalogNumber":{"number":"117","suffix":"T","formatted":"117T"},"displayName":"ENGLISH 117T","title":"Shakespeare in the Theatre","transcriptTitle":"SHAKESPEARE\/THEATRE"},"offeringNumber":1,"session":{"term":{"id":"2188","name":"2018 Fall"},"id":"1","name":"Regular Academic Session"},"number":"001","displayName":"2018 Fall ENGLISH 117T 001","allowedUnits":{"minimum":4,"maximum":4,"forAcademicProgress":4,"forFinancialAid":4}},"attributes":{"VUOC":[{"attribute":{"code":"VUOC","description":"VCREDIT","formalDescription":"Variable Units of Credit"},"value":{"code":"F","description":"Fixed","formalDescription":"Fixed Unit 1 Value"}}],"TIE":[{"attribute":{"code":"TIE","description":"Instr Type","formalDescription":"Instructional Activity Types"},"value":{"code":"STDP","description":"Studio-Production\/Creative Dev","formalDescription":"Initiating Intellectual Independence"}}],"GE":[{"attribute":{"code":"GE","description":"Breadth","formalDescription":"Breadth Requirements"},"value":{"code":"AL","description":"Arts & Literature","formalDescription":"Meets Arts & Literature, L&S Breadth"}}],"NOTE":{"special-title":{"attribute":{"code":"NOTE","formalDescription":"Special Title"},"value":{"code":"4","formalDescription":"Cymbeline"}},"class-description":{"attribute":{"code":"NOTE","formalDescription":"Class Description"},"value":{"code":"2","formalDescription":"Imagine that the play is an exquisite silk dress.
