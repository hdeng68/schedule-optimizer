The course provides the opportunity to synthesize the skills you have acquired through your summer core coursework and apply these skills to real world policy problems. We open the course with a discussion of what it is that policy analysts do and how their work fits into the broader policy process. We then move into an overview of the policy analysis framework, drawing on the eightfold path you were introduced to in the Policy Frameworks course.
