Its objective is to move students toward a greater level of fluency in each of these key areas. Students will be introduced to a variety of contemporary literary genres. Weekly readings and discussions will be on short stories, poems, and dramatic sketches from representative authors. These readings focus on various social, cultural, political, and historical aspects of Indian society. Students are encouraged to explore these issues in their written assignments as well as in their class discussions. Written assignments on themes suggested by the reading will be required. We will also work on advanced grammar and special attention will be given to matters of style and idiom. The class will be conducted entirely in Hindi and students will acquire language skills sufficient to approach literary texts on their own.
