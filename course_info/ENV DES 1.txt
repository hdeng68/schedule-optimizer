start to be a designer, not just of drawings and objects, but also buildings, landscapes, and urban spaces. And not just in isolation, but in the complex web of ecological and man-made systems which makes up our shifting environment. You will take from the course first-hand experience of drawing, measuring, and design \u2014 which form the basis of the professions of architecture, landscape architecture, and urban planning\u2014 and which culminate in a final design project in the course.
