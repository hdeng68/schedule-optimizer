Student teams will work with preliminary data to define the problem. They will then collect and analyze interview and survey data from potential users and begin to design a solution. Students will explore how to use novel monitoring technologies and \u201cbig data\u201d for  product improvement and evaluation. The student teams will use the case studies (with improvements based on  user feedback and data analysis) to develop a plan for  scaling and evaluation with a rigorous controlled trial.","academicCareer":{"code":"GRAD","description":"Graduate"},"academicGroup":{"code":"COE","description":"Clg of Engineering"},"academicOrganization":{"code":"GGDEVEN","description":"Development Eng Grad Grp"},"departmentNicknames":"development engineering","primaryInstructionMethod":{"code":"LEC","description":"Instructor presentation of course materials"},"credit":{"type":"fixed","value":{"fixed":{"units":3}}},"gradingBasis":{"code":"letter","description":"letter"},"blindGrading":false,"status":{"code":"ACTIVE","description":"ACTIVE"},"fromDate":"2014-08-21","createdDate":"2014-04-19","updatedDate":"2014-07-16","printInCatalog":true,"printInstructors":true,"anyFeesExist":false,"finalExam":{"code":"Y","description":"Written final exam conducted during the scheduled final exam period"},"instructorDropConsentRequired":false,"allowMultipleEnrollments":false,"contactHours":3,"workloadHours":9,"tie":{"code":"LECT","description":"LECT"},"cip":{"code":"MISSINGcipCode","description":"MISSINGcipCode"},"hegis":{"code":"MISSINGhegisCode","description":"MISSINGhegisCode"},"repeatability":{"repeatable":false},"creditRestriction":{"restrictionText":"","restrictionCourses":{"creditRestrictionCourses":[{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"bc66c61f-781b-402c-84dc-2fc2867e5e18"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"124454"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"1dd4ca1f-fbb3-4fdb-b257-fb148473873e"}],"displayName":"DEV ENG C200"},"maxCreditPercentage":100}]}},"courseObjectives":["Students will use multiple qualitative and quantitative methods to learn about user needs, to come up with new concepts and solutions, and to understand how new products and services achieve or fail  to achieve their goals in a development setting."],"studentLearningOutcomes":["Students will develop a set of skills that will allow them to flourish in a climate of complex problem solving and design challenges in development engineering","Students will be able to apply the skills to current challenges in development engineering","Students will learn how to learn from users using qualitative and quantitative tools including surveys, interviews, new monitoring technologies, statistical analyses and experimental designs","Students will learn to participate in and lead innovation and creativity in collaborative settings"],"proposedInstructors":["Agogino, Levine"],"formatsOffered":{"description":"Three hours of lecture per week.
