We'll ask about the necessities of black invention; about its luxuries, its excesses, and its pleasures. And we'll use diasporic theory to think about what happens, politically and conceptually, when we attend to black differences as we do to the shifts in tonality and meaning between versions of a song.\n\nThe texts for this course will be available at University Press Books, on Bancroft Way.
