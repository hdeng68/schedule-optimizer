The topic of the seminar will change from semester to semester, following themes chosen by the instructor and the participants. The seminar is an opportunity for students and faculty to present their recent and ongoing work for in-depth review and commentary. In addition, visitors to the campus with expertise relevant to the topic(s) under examination will be invited to present at the seminar and join in the discussion.
