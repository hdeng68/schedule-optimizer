Climate change is caused by a large variety of economic activities, and many of its impacts will have economic consequences. Economists have studied climate change for more than two decades, and economic arguments are often powerful in policy decisions. The course will familiarize students with these arguments and equip them with the tools to participate in discussions of climate change policy through an economic lens.The graduate-level version of this course requires additional assignments.","academicCareer":{"code":"GRAD","description":"Graduate"},"academicGroup":{"code":"CNR","description":"Clg of Natural Resources"},"academicOrganization":{"code":"ENERES","description":"Energy & Resources Grad Grp"},"departmentNicknames":"ENE RES!ER!","primaryInstructionMethod":{"code":"LEC","description":"Instructor presentation of course materials"},"credit":{"type":"fixed","value":{"fixed":{"units":4}}},"gradingBasis":{"code":"letter","description":"letter"},"blindGrading":false,"status":{"code":"ACTIVE","description":"ACTIVE"},"fromDate":"2016-05-23","createdDate":"2015-10-08","updatedDate":"2015-11-13","printInCatalog":true,"printInstructors":true,"anyFeesExist":false,"finalExam":{"code":"Y","description":"Written final exam conducted during the scheduled final exam period"},"instructorDropConsentRequired":false,"allowMultipleEnrollments":false,"contactHours":4,"workloadHours":14,"tie":{"code":"LECS","description":"LECS"},"cip":{"code":"MISSINGcipCode","description":"MISSINGcipCode"},"hegis":{"code":"MISSINGhegisCode","description":"MISSINGhegisCode"},"repeatability":{"repeatable":false},"creditRestriction":{"restrictionText":"","restrictionCourses":{"creditRestrictionCourses":[{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"47b001b2-d742-4104-b716-75591832b29d"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"125375"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"bf622d9b-b0d4-4b61-b821-9f38337bf506"}],"displayName":"ENE,RES 276"},"maxCreditPercentage":100},{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"c1e8ca90-e0aa-4075-b75c-c309012ff2e5"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"125375"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"bf622d9b-b0d4-4b61-b821-9f38337bf506"}],"displayName":"ENE,RES 276"},"maxCreditPercentage":100}]}},"courseObjectives":["Students will be familiar with the tools economists use to analyze climate change policy. Graduate students will gain experience writing policy analysis through a series of policy memos. They will have studied empirical estimates of the costs and benefits of climate policy and have an understanding of the analytical issues that drive research on the economics of climate change. Students will also have gained insight into the practical aspects of modeling the economics of climate change by building an integrated assessment model in Excel. They will be able to use that model to do analysis of climate change policy themselves. \n"],"proposedInstructors":["Anthoff"],"formatsOffered":{"description":"Three hours of lecture and one hour of discussion per week.
