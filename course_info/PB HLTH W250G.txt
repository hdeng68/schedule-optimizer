Topics include potential sources of bias, confounding, and effect modification in each research design are explored in depth); topics in clinical epidemiology including the use of likelihood ratios, receiver operator curves, and the sensitivity, specificity, predictive value of a test; and a brief introduction to logistic regression and survival analysis. These topics are covered at a more advanced level than in PH250A or PHW250. The readings from this course are drawn primarily from advanced epidemiology textbooks (e.g., Kleinbaum, Rothman). The course is intended to provide a firm foundation for students who will later enroll in 250C.","academicCareer":{"code":"GRAD","description":"Graduate"},"academicGroup":{"code":"PBHLT","description":"School of Public Health"},"academicOrganization":{"code":"PUBHEALTH","description":"Public Health"},"departmentNicknames":"PH!PUBHLTH!PUBLIC HEALTH!","primaryInstructionMethod":{"code":"WBL","description":"Web-based or technologically-mediated activities replacing standard lectures (effective Fall 2006)"},"credit":{"type":"fixed","value":{"fixed":{"units":3}}},"gradingBasis":{"code":"letter","description":"letter"},"blindGrading":false,"status":{"code":"ACTIVE","description":"ACTIVE"},"fromDate":"2018-08-15","toDate":"2099-12-19","createdDate":"2018-02-26","updatedDate":"2018-03-09","printInCatalog":true,"printInstructors":true,"anyFeesExist":false,"finalExam":{"code":"N","description":"No final exam"},"instructorDropConsentRequired":false,"allowMultipleEnrollments":false,"contactHours":6,"workloadHours":22,"tie":{"code":"LECT","description":"LECT"},"cip":{"code":"MISSINGcipCode","description":"MISSINGcipCode"},"hegis":{"code":"MISSINGhegisCode","description":"MISSINGhegisCode"},"repeatability":{"repeatable":false},"preparation":{"requiredText":"PB HLTH 150A, PB HLTH 250A, or PB HLTH W250","requiredCourses":[]},"proposedInstructors":["Colford, Benjamin-Chung"],"formatsOffered":{"description":"Six hours of web-based lecture per week for 8 weeks.
