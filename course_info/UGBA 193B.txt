Today we are at the precipice of what many hope will be a major paradigm shift in energy production and use.  Two transitions are needed. On the one hand, we must find ways to extend the benefits of our existing energy system to the impoverished people living in the developing world while continuing to provide these benefits to the people of the developed world.  On the other hand, we must completely overhaul the existing system to fight climate change and other forms of air and water pollution. Are these shifts truly within our reach?  Can we achieve both simultaneously?  If so, how? This Big Ideas course will grapple with these questions using an interdisciplinary systems approach.","academicCareer":{"code":"UGRD","description":"Undergraduate"},"academicGroup":{"code":"BUS","description":"Haas School of Business"},"academicOrganization":{"code":"BUS","description":"Business"},"departmentNicknames":"","primaryInstructionMethod":{"code":"LEC","description":"Instructor presentation of course materials"},"credit":{"type":"fixed","value":{"fixed":{"units":4}}},"gradingBasis":{"code":"letter","description":"letter"},"blindGrading":false,"status":{"code":"ACTIVE","description":"ACTIVE"},"fromDate":"2016-08-17","createdDate":"2016-03-22","updatedDate":"2016-04-08","printInCatalog":true,"printInstructors":true,"anyFeesExist":false,"finalExam":{"code":"Y","description":"Written final exam conducted during the scheduled final exam period"},"instructorDropConsentRequired":false,"allowMultipleEnrollments":false,"contactHours":4,"workloadHours":12,"tie":{"code":"LECS","description":"LECS"},"cip":{"code":"MISSINGcipCode","description":"MISSINGcipCode"},"hegis":{"code":"MISSINGhegisCode","description":"MISSINGhegisCode"},"repeatability":{"repeatable":false},"creditRestriction":{"restrictionText":"Students who take UGBA 193B will not receive credit for L&S 126.","restrictionCourses":{"creditRestrictionCourses":[{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"09f0fa1d-4eac-4317-8c7d-332e9a0c5984"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"125742"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"eba07799-7bcc-469f-a16d-e97c7f6e350c"}],"displayName":"UGBA 193B"},"maxCreditPercentage":100}]}},"proposedInstructors":[""],"formatsOffered":{"description":"Three hours of lecture and one hour of discussion per week.
