Students will work in a laboratory setting on systems ranging in complexity from desktop experiments with only a few instruments up to systems such as an internal combustion engine with a wide variety of sensors. State-of-the-art software for data acquisition and analysis will be introduced and used throughout the course. The role of error and uncertainty, and uncertainty propagation, in measurements and analysis will be examined. Design of experiments will be addressed through examples and homework.  The role and limitations of spectral analysis of digital data will be discussed.","academicCareer":{"code":"UGRD","description":"Undergraduate"},"academicGroup":{"code":"COE","description":"Clg of Engineering"},"academicOrganization":{"code":"MECENG","description":"Mechanical Engineering"},"departmentNicknames":"ME!MECENG!MECH!MECH ENG!MECHANICAL ENGINEERING!MECHENG!","primaryInstructionMethod":{"code":"LEC","description":"Instructor presentation of course materials"},"credit":{"type":"fixed","value":{"fixed":{"units":4}}},"gradingBasis":{"code":"letter","description":"letter"},"blindGrading":false,"status":{"code":"ACTIVE","description":"ACTIVE"},"fromDate":"2018-01-09","createdDate":"2017-04-12","updatedDate":"2017-05-05","printInCatalog":true,"printInstructors":true,"anyFeesExist":false,"finalExam":{"code":"Y","description":"Written final exam conducted during the scheduled final exam period"},"instructorDropConsentRequired":false,"allowMultipleEnrollments":false,"contactHours":6,"workloadHours":12,"tie":{"code":"LECS","description":"LECS"},"cip":{"code":"MISSINGcipCode","description":"MISSINGcipCode"},"hegis":{"code":"MISSINGhegisCode","description":"MISSINGhegisCode"},"repeatability":{"repeatable":false},"creditRestriction":{"restrictionText":"Students will not receive credit for this course if they have taken both ME 102A and ME 107.","restrictionCourses":{"creditRestrictionCourses":[{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"fc6406ff-caaa-4edc-9d07-a4621ec06403"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"154870"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"61701df8-ff76-4d3b-9007-0f121b305145"}],"displayName":"MEC ENG 103"},"maxCreditPercentage":100},{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"fc6406ff-caaa-4edc-9d07-a4621ec06403"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"154870"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"61701df8-ff76-4d3b-9007-0f121b305145"}],"displayName":"MEC ENG 103"},"maxCreditPercentage":100}]}},"courseObjectives":["Introduce students to modern experimental techniques for mechanical engineering; provide exposure to and experience with a variety of sensors, including those to measure temperature, displacement, velocity, acceleration and strain; examine the role of error and uncertainty in measurements and analysis; exposure to and experience in using commercial software for data acquisition and analysis; discuss the role and limitations of spectral analysis of digital data; provide experience in working in a team in all aspects of the laboratory exercises, including set-up, data collection, analysis, technical report writing and oral presentation."],"studentLearningOutcomes":["(a) an ability to apply knowledge of mathematics, science, and engineering\n(b) an ability to design and conduct experiments, as well as to analyze and interpret data \n(c) an ability to function on multi-disciplinary teams \n(d) an ability to identify, formulate, and solve engineering problems \n(e) an understanding of professional and ethical responsibility \n(f) an ability to communicate effectively \n(g) the broad education necessary to understand the impact of engineering solutions in a global, economic, environmental, and societal context \n(h) a recognition of the need for, and an ability to engage in life-long learning \n(j) a knowledge of contemporary issues \n(i) an ability to use the techniques, skills, and modern engineering tools necessary for engineering practice."],"proposedInstructors":["Johnson, Makiharju, Chen"],"formatsOffered":{"description":"Three hours of lecture and three hours of laboratory per week.
