Providing the basic tools for analyzing film language, the course begins by analyzing the interactions between early Japanese film and early Hollywood. We then consider the development of Japanese film, discussing style and structures of connotation, figurative meaning and political critique, the uses of the historical past and ideology, and the roles of youth culture and views of the family. We consider the place of important individual directors. We also discuss current critical debates about broader trends in Japanese film and culture, as they illuminate the construction and ruptures in notions of Japanese identity.","academicCareer":{"code":"UGRD","description":"Undergraduate"},"academicGroup":{"code":"CLS","description":"Clg of Letters & Science"},"academicOrganization":{"code":"EALANG","description":"East Asian Lang & Culture"},"departmentNicknames":"","primaryInstructionMethod":{"code":"LEC","description":"Instructor presentation of course materials"},"credit":{"type":"fixed","value":{"fixed":{"units":4}}},"gradingBasis":{"code":"letter","description":"letter"},"blindGrading":false,"status":{"code":"ACTIVE","description":"ACTIVE"},"fromDate":"2014-08-21","toDate":"2099-12-19","createdDate":"2014-08-11","updatedDate":"2014-08-22","printInCatalog":true,"printInstructors":true,"anyFeesExist":false,"finalExam":{"code":"Y","description":"Written final exam conducted during the scheduled final exam period"},"instructorDropConsentRequired":false,"allowMultipleEnrollments":false,"spansMultipleTerms":false,"multipleTermNumber":0,"contactHours":5,"workloadHours":14,"tie":{"code":"LECS","description":"LECS"},"cip":{"code":"MISSINGcipCode","description":"MISSINGcipCode"},"hegis":{"code":"MISSINGhegisCode","description":"MISSINGhegisCode"},"repeatability":{"repeatable":true,"description":"Course may be repeated for credit as topic varies.
