Given that most of the underlying forces causing this trend in the U.S. are also prevalent in other nations, the lessons learned in this course are likely to be relevant elsewhere. The course is also intended to provide insights into the political and public policy debates that have arisen in light of this divergence, as well as possible means of reversing it.","academicCareer":{"code":"GRAD","description":"Graduate"},"academicGroup":{"code":"GSPP","description":"Goldman School Public Policy"},"academicOrganization":{"code":"PUBPOL","description":"Public Policy"},"departmentNicknames":"PUBLIC POLICY!PUBPOL!","primaryInstructionMethod":{"code":"LEC","description":"Instructor presentation of course materials"},"credit":{"type":"fixed","value":{"fixed":{"units":4}}},"gradingBasis":{"code":"letter","description":"letter"},"blindGrading":false,"status":{"code":"ACTIVE","description":"ACTIVE"},"fromDate":"2017-08-16","createdDate":"2017-03-13","updatedDate":"2017-04-07","printInCatalog":true,"printInstructors":true,"anyFeesExist":false,"finalExam":{"code":"N","description":"No final exam"},"instructorDropConsentRequired":false,"allowMultipleEnrollments":false,"contactHours":6,"workloadHours":12,"tie":{"code":"LECS","description":"LECS"},"cip":{"code":"MISSINGcipCode","description":"MISSINGcipCode"},"hegis":{"code":"MISSINGhegisCode","description":"MISSINGhegisCode"},"repeatability":{"repeatable":false},"creditRestriction":{"restrictionText":"","restrictionCourses":{"creditRestrictionCourses":[{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"5878f8fa-e8fd-4006-98e3-32671c4ea4de"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"154663"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"373d73db-53f6-461a-b782-8bf025a4e678"}],"displayName":"PUB POL 271"},"maxCreditPercentage":100},{"course":{"identifiers":[{"type":"cms-id","id":"5878f8fa-e8fd-4006-98e3-32671c4ea4de"},{"type":"cs-course-id","id":"154663"},{"type":"cms-version-independent-id","id":"373d73db-53f6-461a-b782-8bf025a4e678"}],"displayName":"PUB POL 271"},"maxCreditPercentage":100}]}},"proposedInstructors":["REICH"],"formatsOffered":{"description":"Four hours of lecture and two hours of discussion per week.
